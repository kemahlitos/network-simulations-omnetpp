# Wireless Network Behavior Analysis

This directory contains a set of **wireless network simulation studies**
implemented using **OMNeT++ and the INET framework**.
The simulations focus on understanding how **wireless channel characteristics,
node placement, and MAC protocols** influence network behavior and performance.

The emphasis is on observing system behavior under changing physical and protocol-level
conditions rather than on fixed topologies.

## Focus of the Studies

The experiments in this study analyze key aspects of wireless communication, including:

- Impact of node distance and placement on communication quality
- Wireless channel capacity and its variation over time
- Sensitivity of performance metrics to physical topology changes
- Comparison of different MAC protocols under identical conditions

The simulations highlight the interaction between the physical layer assumptions
and medium access mechanisms.

## Experiments Included

- **Topology variation experiments**  
  Analyze how moving nodes and changing relative distances affect connectivity and
  performance metrics.

- **Wireless channel capacity analysis**  
  Measure achievable channel capacity over time under fixed simulation intervals.

- **MAC protocol comparison**  
  Compare CSMA-based protocols with alternative MAC mechanisms to observe differences
  in throughput, delay, and channel usage.

Each experiment is configured through OMNeT++ configuration files, enabling controlled
and repeatable comparisons.

## Notes

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate **wireless network reasoning through simulation**,
with a focus on protocol behavior, physical constraints, and their combined impact on
observable network performance.
